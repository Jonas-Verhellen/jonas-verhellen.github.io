									<p style="text-align:justify">Welcome to my blog! This summer, I am embarking on an exciting outreach adventure by sharing my PhD research with you. Each week, I will release a new blog post where I unpack a specific aspect of my scientific work. The best part? I will be presenting the information in bite-sized, easily understandable chunks of text! So, whether you are a fellow academic, a curious mind, or simply looking to expand your knowledge, this blog is here to serve you. Throughout the text and in each image you can find links to more detailed sources of information for the topics I discuss here. This summer's final blog post focusses on the wide variety of different requirements a successful drug needs to fulfill. Enjoy!

											Medical drugs are essential tools in modern healthcare, and they function by interacting with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00733-x">specific biological targets</a> within the human body or in pathogens such as the SARS-Cov-2 virus. These targets can include proteins, RNA, DNA, and lipids, all of which play critical roles in various biological pathways. When a drug binds to one of these targets, it can modulate or alter the activity of that target, effectively interfering with or enhancing important biological processes. This modulation can be particularly crucial in the context of disease. By selectively targeting and modifying the activity of specific molecules, drugs can help restore balance in disrupted cellular processes, alleviate symptoms, or even cure certain medical conditions. In essence, medical drugs are designed to act as precise tools that harness our understanding of biology to alter molecular processes to combat diseases and improve human health.

											Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) collectively describe the critical processes that govern the fate of a drug within the human body. Absorption relates to how a drug enters the bloodstream from its administration site, which can be through the mouth, skin, or other routes. Distribution refers to how the drug spreads throughout the body, often influenced by factors such as blood flow and tissue affinity. Metabolism involves the transformation of the drug into different compounds by enzymes, typically in the liver, while excretion is the elimination of the drug and its metabolites from the body, often through urine or feces. ADME has been <a href="https://modrn.yale.edu/education/undergraduate-curriculum/modrn-u-modules/adme-and-toxicology">a fundamental concept in pharmacology</a> for half a century. Understanding ADME is pivotal in drug development and ensures that medications are safe and effective, as it guides researchers in optimizing drug formulations and dosages for maximum therapeutic benefit.

											Drug-induced toxicities are adverse effects or harm caused by medications when they interact with the body in unintended ways. These toxicities can manifest in various forms, including organ damage, allergic reactions, or disruptions to essential biological processes. For instance, hepatotoxicity refers to damage to the liver caused by certain drugs while nephrotoxicity involves <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrneph.2017.168">harm to the kidneys</a>, potentially leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. One of the most concerning toxicities is drug-induced cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity can lead to a range of cardiac problems, such as irregular heart rhythms, damage to heart muscle, or even heart failure. Close monitoring and a thorough understanding of potential toxicities are critical in both drug development and clinical practice. This ensures that medications are administered safely, with healthcare professionals carefully weighing the benefits against the risks for each patient.
